Simply paste in a list of Movies and/or TV shows, and it will return the same list sorted by IMDB score. 

I got the idea for this webapp when I realised both me and my girlfriend occasionally spend a lot of time looking up
numerous films on MetaCritic/IMDB when trying to decide what to watch.

The user can type in any number of Movies or TV/shows into a single search box, and the App will return for each title:

- The MetaCritic score
- The IMDB score
- the Rotten Tomatoes score
- A link to trailers on YouTube
- A short description of the title.
- The Runtime (if it is a movie).
- The number of seasons (if it is a TV show)
- A picture of the Poster.
